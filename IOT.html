        <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
        <p> The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to collect and exchange data over the internet. This network includes everything from smart home appliances to sophisticated industrial machinery, enabling automation, data-driven insights, and new digital services. IoT systems work by using sensors to collect data, a connectivity method (like Wi-Fi or 5G) to transmit it, and cloud or edge processing to analyze the data and trigger actions, often through a user interface. </p>
