        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <p> Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn from data and improve without being explicitly programmed for every task. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in large datasets, enabling systems to make predictions or decisions on new data. Common applications include image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.  </p>
